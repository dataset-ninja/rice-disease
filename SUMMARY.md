**Rice leaf diseases with boundary box** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the agriculture industry.

The dataset consists of 470 images with 1956 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *Bacterial_Blight*, *Brown_Spot*, and *Rice_Blast*.

Each image in the Rice Disease dataset has bounding boxes annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (61 images), *valid* (87 images), and *train* (322 images). The dataset was released in 2021.
